## Features & Submitting a Pull Request


### Features

Features should relate to GitHub Issues. They should be something very specific, like adding controls to a form. Features should get their own branch. For example, you could do

```shell
git checkout -b bherion/1-some-work
```

The format is as follows:

```shell
git checkout -b {first-initial}{last-name}/{issue-number}-{short-description}
```

COMMIT OFTEN SO YOU DON'T LOSE ANY WORK

### Pull Requests

Click the green 'Create a Pull Request' button on your branch and target 'main' to merge into. Go through the setup process and if you want someone else to review, just ping them.
